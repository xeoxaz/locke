# Locke

## A Bun Discord Bot
> Spartan Jameson Locke (service number 73808-3153-JL) is a Spartan-IV supersoldier and a former Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) agent. 
> Before becoming a Spartan, Locke held the rank of lieutenant commander and served under ONIâ€™s Section III as an Acquisitions Specialist. 
> His responsibilities included retrieving important objects from the enemy and tracking and assassinating high-value individuals.

Using ollama (lama 2 ai model), I have swapped tinidolphin for the core "locke".

```
    FROM gemma
    PARAMETER temperature 0
    PARAMETER num_ctx 1024
    SYSTEM Your a spartan from halo. Your name is Locke.
```

> While using discord, typing it's name first then message: "Locke, how are you?". The bot working as the middleware will send the message to *locke* then returned to discord chat.

As ollama is a chat bot all by its self. You can use ollama to hold the history of the chat.
